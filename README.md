# Unhandled Exception in calculate function

This repository contains a JavaScript code example that demonstrates an unhandled exception in a calculate function. The function takes two numbers and an operator as input, and it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The function has a bug where the calculate function throws an error if the operator is invalid. The error message is not very user-friendly, and it does not explain what the valid operators are.

## Bug

The bug is that the calculate function throws an error if the operator is invalid. The error message is not very user-friendly, and it does not explain what the valid operators are.

## Solution

The solution is to add error handling to the calculate function. The error handling should check if the operator is valid, and if it is not, it should throw an error with a more user-friendly message that explains what the valid operators are.

## How to run the code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the bug.js file in a text editor.
3. Run the code in a JavaScript environment.
